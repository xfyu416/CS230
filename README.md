# CS230
Hi welcome to xfy's CS230 project.

Because of upload size limitations, the full data set used to train the model can not be uploaded. (>500mb)
For test run purposes I've created a simple set of data named "xDataSample.pkl", "genreDataSample.pkl" and "featDataSample.pkl".
For Full Sized Data, please visit:

These are preprocessed data ready to be used in model training.

The actual raw data was downloaded from: https://github.com/mdeff/fma
The spotify features data were then obtained using GetSpotifyFeaturesForSongs.py
After which mel-spectrograms were generated using GenerateXYData.py, and the features data, genre data were processed to create the pkl files. These pkl files were uploaded to the links above, and the sample data in this repo are simply the first 150 data points.

The rest of the project were done in Model Training Tuning Evaluating.ipynb

Thanks for reading.
